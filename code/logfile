MapReduce is a programming model and an associ-
ated implementation for processing and generating large
data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a
key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
values associated with the same intermediate key. Many
real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown
in the paper.
Programs written in this functional style are automati-
cally parallelized and executed on a large cluster of com-
modity machines. The run-time system takes care of the
details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the pro-
gram’s execution across a set of machines, handling ma-
chine failures, and managing the required inter-machine
communication. This allows programmers without any
experience with parallel and distributed systems to eas-
ily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.
Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large
cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable:
a typical MapReduce computation processes many ter-
abytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers
find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce pro-
grams have been implemented and upwards of one thou-
sand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters
every day.
