This paper presents a new technique for disk storage management
called a log-structured
file
system, A log-structured
file system writes all modifications
to disk sequentially
in a log-like
structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure
on disk; it contains indexing information
so that files can be read back from the log efficiently.
In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and
from heavily fragmented
segments. We
use a segment cleaner to compress the live information
present a series of simulations
that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based
on cost and benefit. We have implemented
a prototype logstructured
file system called Sprite
LFS; it outperforms
current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude
for small-file
writes
while matching
or exceeding Unix performance
for reads and large writes. Even when the
overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth
for writing,
whereas Unix file systems typically
can use only 5 – 10%.
